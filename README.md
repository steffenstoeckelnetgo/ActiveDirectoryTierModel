# 🏛️ Tier Model

Declarative PowerShell framework to deploy and audit an Active Directory Tier Model (OUs, Groups, Users, ACL Delegations, GPOs, ADMX, MSA/gMSA/dMSA Permissions, Windows LAPS Permissions) from a single version-controlled JSON configuration file. Supports idempotent re-runs, drift detection, and reproducible builds via pinned dependency versions.

> 🏗️ **Built with the Specify Framework** - Test-driven development ensuring quality and reliability

## 🎯 Goals
- 🔒 Safe, repeatable deployments (WhatIf planning + convergent apply)
- 📊 Drift auditing & reporting (hash provenance + structured findings)
- 🧩 Modular, test-first architecture (Pester enforced)
- 📦 Version governance for dependencies & configuration schema

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

**Current Test Status: ✅ 1,994 passing / 0 failures (100%)** *(Last run: 2026-09-08)*

| Test Suite | Test Files | Test Cases | Status | Coverage |
|------------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Unit Tests** | **26 files** (Pester) | **1,664 tests** | ✅ All pass | **87.63%** *(CI-scoped 82-file module population)* |
| **Integration Tests** | **7 files** (Pester) | **330 tests** | ✅ All pass | **87.63%** *(CI-scoped 82-file module population)* |
| **Manual Integration Tests** | **1 file** (Excel workbook) | **384 tests** | ✅ 100% Pass | **N/A** |
| **Total** | **34 files** | **2,378 tests** | ✅ **100% passing** | **87.63%** *(CI-scoped 82-file module population)* |

### Test Coverage Highlights
- ✅ **86/86** production PowerShell files in the product surface counted: 2 root `*-TierModel.ps1`, 82 under `modules\`, and 2 under `optional\`; CI coverage measures the CI-scoped 82-file module population
- ✅ **1,994 / 1,994** automated test cases passing — 0 failures (Pester 5.9.0, 2026-09-08)
- ✅ **87.63%** overall Pester-measured command coverage across the CI-scoped 82-file module population (aggregate clears the 80% CI gate; the gate is not per-file)

### Running Tests

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome — but this is a **security-sensitive** project, so we follow an
**issue-first** process. Please read **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** before opening a
pull request.

**The process, in short:**

1. 🗣️ **Open an issue first** describing the problem or proposal — for *any* change (feature, fix, refactor, config, or docs).
2. 🧭 **Discuss and get maintainer agreement** on scope and approach **before writing code**.
3. 🔀 **Then open a focused PR** that links the agreed issue and implements only what was agreed.

> ⚠️ **Pull requests without a linked, pre-agreed issue will be closed.** Unsolicited new
> parameters, alternate deployment topologies, relaxed security validation, or
> bundled / reformat-heavy changes are rejected on sight — not to be unwelcoming, but
> because unreviewed changes to a tiering-security tool can silently weaken tier
> boundaries. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full rationale.

When your PR is ready, it must also satisfy:

1. ✅ **All Pester tests pass** — the CI pipeline will reject any PR with failing tests
2. 🧪 **New or updated tests are included** — any new code or bug fix must include corresponding test cases to maintain or improve code coverage
3. 📊 **Code coverage stays at or above 80%** — the CI enforces a minimum coverage threshold; if your changes reduce coverage below 80%, add tests until coverage is restored
4. 📝 Documentation is updated for any new or changed functionality
5. 🎯 Code follows project conventions and keeps the diff focused (no unrelated reformatting)

> **Note:** The packaging step will not produce a release artifact unless all tests pass and coverage meets the minimum threshold.

### Development Setup
```powershell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ActiveDirectoryTierModel.git
cd ActiveDirectoryTierModel

# Run tests locally before submitting a PR
.\tests\Invoke-AllTests.ps1
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **PowerShell**: 7.0+
- **Elevation**: Administrator privileges required
- **Domain Admin**: Membership in Domain Admins group
- **Modules**: ActiveDirectory, GroupPolicy (see `config/dependencies.json`)
- **Language**: English (`en-US`) only — both the **host OS** (the machine you run the scripts from) and **Active Directory** must be English (see [Language Support](https://microsoft.github.io/ActiveDirectoryTierModel/language-support/))

*For detailed prerequisite validation, run `Test-TierModelPrerequisites`*

## 📊 Monitoring

Out-of-the-box Microsoft Sentinel monitoring for a deployed Tier Model is available as a solution in the **Azure Content Hub**. The solution covers Tier Model–specific detection and triage — no custom playbooks or watchlists required. The only hard requirement is that every Domain Controller's Security event logs must be flowing into the Sentinel workspace; any DC not onboarded is a blind spot.

## 🚀 Releasing

This project uses **semantic versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and tag-based releases.

| Bump | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `PATCH` (1.0.**1**) | Bug fix, typo, doc correction | Fix broken ACL rule |
| `MINOR` (1.**1**.0) | New feature, backward-compatible | Add WinLAPS parameter |
| `MAJOR` (**2**.0.0) | Breaking change | Restructure config schema |

### Creating a release

1. Ensure all changes are merged to `main` and CI is green
2. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.1.0
   git push origin v1.1.0
   ```
3. The CI pipeline will automatically:
   - Run all tests and enforce code coverage (80% minimum)
   - Create a `TierModel-1.1.0.zip` release asset
   - Publish a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes

You can also create a release from the GitHub UI: **Releases → Create a new release → enter the tag name** (e.g. `v1.1.0`).
