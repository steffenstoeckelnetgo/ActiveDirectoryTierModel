# Changelog

All notable changes to the TierModel project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **German (and any localized) Active Directory support.** `Deploy-TierModel` and
  `Audit-TierModel` now run against a domain installed in any language, from a host
  installed in any language. The English names in `config/*.json` are treated as
  canonical identifiers and resolved to well-known SIDs rather than looked up by
  directory name, so one configuration set works everywhere and keeps working where a
  built-in group has been renamed. English and German are the regression-tested
  combinations. See `docs/language-support.md` and
  `specs/008-german-language-support/`.
- `Get-TierModelCanonicalPrincipal` / `Resolve-TierModelCanonicalSid` (module-internal):
  canonical English name to well-known RID, composed against the target domain SID and
  verified by reading the object back. The read-back keeps forest-root groups
  unresolvable in a child domain and absent optional groups (Allowed RODC Password
  Replication Group) resolving to nothing, so callers skip them instead of writing an
  unresolvable SID into `[Privilege Rights]`.
- `optional/New-TierModelAdmlManifest.ps1`: generates `config/tiermodel-adml-<lang>.json`
  with MD5 hashes from a folder of ADML files, so adding a language to the central store
  is a content drop plus one command. The ADML files themselves are Microsoft
  redistributables and are not in this repository.
- `tests/Unit.CanonicalPrincipal.Tests.ps1`: resolution against a German-directory
  fixture where every English name lookup fails, proving no code path depends on the name.

### Fixed
- **A failed Deny-Apply GPO ACE no longer passes as success.** `New-TierModelGpo`
  downgraded the failure to a yellow console warning, so
  `*- Tier Model Account Restrictions` could deploy without its Domain Controllers
  protection while the run reported success — a silently weakened tier boundary. The ACE
  is now built from a SID and a failure fails the GPO action, making the deployment
  non-convergent. **This is a behaviour change for English deployments too.**
- Windows LAPS delegation was not idempotent and reported false drift on a localized
  host. SELF detection and the administrative holder allow-list compared
  client-translated account names (`NT-AUTORITÄT\SELBST`,
  `VORDEFINIERT\Administratoren`), so the SELF ACE looked absent on every run and every
  legitimate holder was flagged. Both now compare SIDs.
- The Windows LAPS planner blocked the whole deployment with `RequiredGroupNotFound`, and
  the audit reported the delegation compliant without checking it, on a localized domain:
  `Get-ADGroup -Filter "Name -eq 'Domain Admins'"` returns an empty result rather than
  throwing. Planner and audit now share `Resolve-TierModelLapsPrincipal`.
- The Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins corroboration lookups in
  `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` resolve by RID 512 / 519 instead of by name; the name
  lookup failed the entire prerequisite check with "Domain Admin membership required"
  against a valid administrator on a German domain.
- `Resolve-ADPrincipalSid` used `-Server $DomainController` without declaring the
  parameter, working only through PowerShell's dynamic scoping from its one caller.
- Timestamps are formatted with `InvariantCulture` so log and report filenames and JSON
  timestamps do not vary with the host's locale.
- **GPO deployment survives a transient SYSVOL condition, and repairs a GPO it left
  half-built.** Three defects that a German lab deployment exposed but that are not
  language-specific and affect English deployments identically:
  - `Import-GPO` clears the target policy folder in SYSVOL before copying into it, so
    back-to-back imports — a full run does 123, several from the same backup source — can
    meet a folder the previous import has not finished releasing. One import failed with
    `ERROR_DIR_NOT_EMPTY` 19 ms after the preceding one from the same source completed.
    The SYSVOL writes in `Import-TierModelGpo` and `Update-TierModelGPOConfig` now retry
    transient file-system conditions with the exponential backoff already used for the
    post-create AD verifications, classifying by HRESULT and never by message text (the
    message is localized). A non-transient failure still throws on the first attempt and a
    transient one that survives every attempt still fails the action — no fail-fast was
    softened.
  - `Get-TierModelGpo` planned Create/Import/Configure only for a GPO that did not exist
    yet, so a GPO whose create succeeded and whose import failed was never repaired: the
    next run saw it as existing, planned only its link, and the deployment reported
    `Converged` over an empty policy. The planner now re-plans Import (and Configure) when
    the GPO's policy folder in SYSVOL is provably empty. The check is deliberately
    asymmetric — a folder that has not replicated to this host, or a SYSVOL that cannot be
    read, changes nothing — because re-importing overwrites settings and must never act on
    a state that could not be read.
  - The consolidated deployment summary counted the same failures twice. The GPO result
    publishes both an `Errors` array and a `Failed` integer for the same failures, and both
    were added: two failed GPO actions printed `Errors: 4`. `Applied`/`Executed` had the
    same shape. Each result is now counted from exactly one source.
- **Authentication Policy Silos could not be deployed against a localized domain.** The
  silo chain passed the configured group name straight to `-Identity`, so
  `Domain Controllers` and `Read-only Domain Controllers` — which the directory serves
  under localized names — resolved to nothing and the prerequisite gate skipped the entire
  silo phase (`FailureCount: 2, Checked: 8` on the German lab domain). The SDDL side
  already resolved by SID; the gate, the membership planner
  (`Get-TierModelAuthSiloMembershipFd`), the membership assignment
  (`Set-TierModelAuthSiloMembership`) and the silo audit (`Test-TierModelAuthSilo`) now do
  the same through the shared, module-internal `Resolve-TierModelGroupIdentity`. In the
  audit the old behaviour was worse than an error: the failed expansion became a
  compliance issue string, so a localized domain audited as non-compliant on principle.
  The gate keeps its `Get-ADGroup` read-back — it is what proves the principal is a group,
  since the resolver's name fallback tries `Get-ADUser` first — only its `-Identity`
  became SID-based.
- A `-FullDeployment` run whose auth silo prerequisites failed printed the failures in red
  and then reported `Deploy script completed successfully` with no silo deployed, because
  the gate result carries none of the shapes the consolidated summary reads. The skipped
  phase now counts as an error and marks the run non-convergent, as the standalone
  `-Include*` path already did.
- The SID cache dropped `ActualName`, so the log line that proves an English configuration
  name points at a localized directory object — `Domain Admins -> ...-512 (Domänen-Admins)` —
  was complete only on the first resolution of a run. Every later caller read
  `ActualName: null`, which is what the auth silo gate logged on the German lab domain,
  because the GPO phase warms the cache long before it runs. Diagnostic only; the SID was
  always correct.

### Changed
- The two English-only prerequisite gates (host install language, well-known group names)
  are removed. The host language, the resolved culture and the canary group names are
  still recorded in `EnvironmentSnapshot` as diagnostics (`HostOsLanguage`, `AdLanguage`,
  and the existing `HostOsEnglish` / `AdLanguageEnglish` / `AdLanguageMismatches` keys),
  but nothing blocks.
- GPO planners classify well-known containers through
  `Test-TierModelWellKnownContainer`, which keeps the existing English literal match and
  additionally compares the container DNs `Get-ADDomain` reports.
- `docs/language-support.md` rewritten: the English-only policy and the "community
  language packs" roadmap are replaced by the SID-resolution mechanism and its rationale.
- Tests brought onto the new contracts: `Unit.GpoOperations` now pins "a failed Deny-Apply
  ACE fails the GPO action" instead of the warn-and-continue behaviour it replaced, and the
  Windows LAPS SELF fixtures carry the SID `S-1-5-10` rather than the literal
  `NT AUTHORITY\SELF`, which a localized host cannot translate and which therefore made the
  correct SID comparison look like a failure.

### Changed
- Reworded documentation and comment attribution that named individual AI agent
  personas, describing the role or the work instead. One such name appeared in a
  comment in shipped module code. Two sample lab OU names in the
  `specs/006-verbose-debug-logging` transcript were renamed for the same reason;
  nothing references them. No documented behavior, requirement, or test claim
  changed.

### Removed
- Removed the `.squad/` folder from version control. It held one contributor's local
  AI-assistant working files and was never part of the project. Contributors are free
  to use whichever agent or squad-based development tooling they prefer. The `.squad/`
  union-merge rules were dropped from `.gitattributes`, and the `specs/**` documents
  that pointed into `.squad/` now reference the specs themselves instead.

### Security
- Pinned every GitHub Action used by the CI workflow to a full-length commit SHA,
  with the human-readable version retained in a trailing comment. Mutable tags such
  as `@v4` can be repointed at malicious code if a maintainer account or release
  process is compromised; a commit SHA cannot. No workflow behavior changed — only
  action resolution became immutable. Contributed by Dan Fiedler.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` so Dependabot tracks the `github-actions` ecosystem
  and proposes SHA updates as maintainers publish new versions, after a 7-day
  cooldown. This keeps the pinned references maintainable.

### Documentation
- Corrected the automated coverage figures in `README.md` and `docs/test-coverage.md`
  to the values CI actually measured: **87.63%** across the CI-scoped 82-file module
  population (14,651 of 16,719 commands), replacing a stale 87.36% / 14,606. Test
  counts and the manual UAT figures are unchanged.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Added `-EnableVerbose` and `-EnableDebug` diagnostic switches to `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` and `Audit-TierModel.ps1`. `-EnableVerbose` raises `$VerbosePreference` so verbose output is emitted throughout the run; `-EnableDebug` raises `$DebugPreference` for deeper diagnostics and is intentionally slower and noisier.
- The switch names are deliberate: PowerShell's common `-Verbose` and `-Debug` parameters remain available and unshadowed.
- Either diagnostic switch auto-enables `-Logging`, and the script announces that it has done so. Diagnostic artifacts are written to a `Debug\` subfolder beside the script, separate from normal logs.
- When both switches are supplied together, the scripts also start a PowerShell transcript. A transcript is not started by either switch alone.
- 🔴 **Transcript warning:** transcripts are not redacted. Review them before attaching one to a public GitHub issue or other external thread.

### Fixed
- Includes a reliability and reporting-accuracy sweep across deployment and audit paths. Per-change engineering detail belongs in the pull request rather than this changelog.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for diagnostic logging behavior and the reliability/reporting sweep.

### Documentation
- Updated operator documentation for diagnostic escalation, output locations, transcript handling, and the logging reference.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-02

Authentication Policy Silos support (#50). Major version because the previous GPO-deployed
Authentication Silo tooling under `optional/TierModel-AuthSilos/` was removed and replaced —
see **Removed** below.

### Added
- **Authentication Policies and Authentication Policy Silos deployment (`-IncludeAuthSilos`)** on `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` (Phase 12) and the matching `-IncludeAuthSilos` scope on `Audit-TierModel.ps1`. Like the other `-Include*` switches it runs standalone or combined with `-FullDeployment`, and cannot be combined with the `-*Only` scopes.
- **New configuration segment `config/tiermodel-authsilos.json`** defining **4 Authentication Policies** and **4 Authentication Policy Silos** — Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 2 EUD. Every object is created with `enforce: false` (**audit mode**) and `protectedFromAccidentalDeletion: true`, so a deployment can never lock accounts out on day one. The Tier 0 policy sets `userTGTLifetimeMinutes: 120`.
- **13 new public cmdlets** (all exported from TierModel 2.0.0):
  - Planners: `Get-TierModelAuthPolicy`, `Get-TierModelAuthSilo`
  - FullDeployment wrappers: `Get-TierModelAuthPolicyFd`, `Get-TierModelAuthSiloFd`, `Get-TierModelAuthSiloMembershipFd`
  - Appliers: `New-TierModelAuthPolicy`, `New-TierModelAuthSilo`, `Set-TierModelAuthSiloMembership`
  - Audit / drift: `Test-TierModelAuthPolicy`, `Test-TierModelAuthSilo`, `Compare-TierModelAuthSddl`
  - Supporting: `Build-TierModelAuthSddl`, `Test-TierModelAuthSiloPrerequisite`
- **Plan-based deployment API**: `Get-TierModelAuthPolicyFd` / `Get-TierModelAuthSiloFd` return plan objects that are passed to `New-TierModelAuthPolicy -Plan` / `New-TierModelAuthSilo -Plan`. `Set-TierModelAuthSiloMembership` is the exception — it takes `-Config` directly and re-evaluates membership on every run, with an optional `-OnlyForSilos` filter so `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` assigns membership only for silos created in that run.
- **Runtime SDDL generation with OR-logic** (`Build-TierModelAuthSddl`): SDDL is deliberately **not** authored in configuration. Each device group name is resolved to a SID at runtime and emitted as `O:SYG:SYD:(XA;OICI;CR;;;WD;(Member_of_any {SID(...), ...}))`, so a device that belongs to **any** listed group satisfies the condition. `Compare-TierModelAuthSddl` performs the drift comparison.
- **`optional/Update-TierModelMembership.ps1`** (new, 2,285 lines): a single reconciliation script covering all three tiers, with tier-level aggregate switches (`-All`, `-AllTier0`, `-AllTier1`, `-AllTier2`), granular per-collection switches (`-Tier0Operators`, `-Tier0PawDevices`, `-Tier2Eud`, `-Tier2EudDevices`, …), exclusion control (`-ExclusionAttribute`, `-ExclusionValue`, `-NoExclusions`), and `-EnableLogging` / `-EnableDebug` / `-EnableEventLog` / `-JobId`. It carries a built-in mapping of the three domain-join service accounts to their tiers (`svc-pawdomainjoin` → Tier 0, `svc-t1srvdomainjoin` → Tier 1, `svc-t2euddomainjoin` → Tier 2); those accounts and the RID-500 built-in Administrator are exempted at runtime rather than being enumerated in configuration.
- **New Tier 2 EUD objects** in the shipped configuration: security groups `Tier2EUDDevices`, `Tier2EUDDomainJoin` and `Tier2PAWDevices` (`config/tiermodel-groups.json`), the `svc-t2euddomainjoin` service account (`config/tiermodel-users.json`), and matching OU ACL delegation (`config/tiermodel-acls.json`).
- **GPO updates**: the *Tier Model Account Restrictions* and *Authentication Silo* GPO backups were replaced with new backup GUIDs carrying updated `registry.pol` and Group Policy Preferences registry settings (`config/tiermodel-gpos.json` updated accordingly).
- **New documentation**: `docs/auth-silos-operations-guide.md` — what gets deployed, how policies/silos/devices are linked, how auth silos complement User Rights Assignment and Restricted Groups, how to read the event log before enforcing, manual maintenance, automation with the reconciliation script, exclusions, logging, limitations, and an **"Appendix: Upgrading from v1.x to v2.0.0"** with ordered migration steps. Added to `docs/index.md`.
- **Specification set** `specs/005-auth-silos/` (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklists/requirements.md`).

### Removed
- **The entire `optional/TierModel-AuthSilos/` tree** — `Deploy-TierModelAuthSilo.ps1`, the six per-tier maintenance scripts (`Update-Tier0AuthSiloUsers.ps1`, `Update-Tier0MemberServers.ps1`, `Update-Tier0PAWDevices.ps1` and their Tier 1 equivalents), the `ScheduleTask-GPO` backup containing `ScheduledTasks.xml`, and the two `ScheduleTask-Local` task definitions. This is the **breaking change** behind the major version bump: silo deployment moved into the module and `-IncludeAuthSilos`, and the six maintenance scripts were consolidated into the single `optional/Update-TierModelMembership.ps1`. Anyone running the v1.x scripts or the GPO-delivered scheduled task must follow the migration appendix in the new operations guide.
- The scheduled-task delivery mechanism changed with it: reconciliation is now documented to run as a **local scheduled task on a writable, Global-Catalog domain controller**, not as a GPO-delivered scheduled task or startup script.

### Changed
- Module version 1.3.3 → **2.0.0** (+13 exported cmdlets).
- `Get-TierModelConfig` loads the new `tiermodel-authsilos.json` segment.

### Tests
- New `tests/Unit.AuthSiloOperations.Tests.ps1` and `tests/Unit.MembershipReconciliation.Tests.ps1`, with supporting additions to `tests/helpers/ADStubs.ps1`, `tests/Unit.ModuleManifest.Tests.ps1` and `tests/Integration.Module.Tests.ps1`.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **Domain Admin prerequisite false-fails under the PowerShell 7 Windows PowerShell compatibility shim (issue #47)**: when `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` ran under PowerShell 7 with an RSAT ActiveDirectory module that is not Core-native (for example on a Windows Server 2016 host, or any host whose AD module edition forces the fallback), PowerShell loaded the module through the Windows PowerShell compatibility shim (WinPSCompatSession) and returned **deserialized** objects — SIDs came back as strings, so the `Get-ADGroupMember | Where-Object { $_.SID -eq $currentUser.User }` membership check compared a deserialized SID against a live `SecurityIdentifier` and never matched. The prerequisite reported *"Domain Admin membership required for deployment operations"* even for a genuine Domain Admin. The ActiveDirectory module is now imported with `-SkipEditionCheck` so PowerShell 7 loads it in-process (native objects, no deserialization), and a fail-fast guard detects the compatibility-shim condition (domain SID returned as a string) and stops with clear remediation — preventing a silent broken deployment in which SID resolution would have written empty principals into URA and GPO restricted-groups policy. Lab-validated: full `-FullDeployment -IncludeMsa -IncludeGmsa -IncludeDmsa -IncludeWinLaps -EnableAuditing` deploy (707 actions, 0 errors, all SIDs resolving) followed by a full audit (418 checks, COMPLIANT, 0 drift).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **Human-readable deployment duration output (issue #34)**: `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` console duration lines now render in a four-tier format — `<1ms` (sub-millisecond/zero), `Xms` (1–999 ms), `Xs` (1–59 s), `Xm Ys` (60 s+) — instead of raw milliseconds. A multi-minute full deployment now displays e.g. `Duration: 4m 23s`; a single-OU idempotent run displays e.g. `Duration: 350ms`; a zero-duration no-op displays `Duration: <1ms` (never zero). All tiers use `Math.Floor`; the minute tier uses explicit floor-based integer arithmetic to avoid `[int][TimeSpan]::TotalMinutes` banker's rounding.
- **`Format-TierModelDuration` public cmdlet** (`modules/TierModel/public/Format-TierModelDuration.ps1`): the formatting primitive backing the above change. Accepts `[double]$Milliseconds`; unit-testable in isolation.
- **Best Practices, Governance & AD Hardening documentation page (issue #33)**: new `docs/best-practices.md` covering AD tier model governance, hardening recommendations, and operational best practices; added to mkdocs nav and linked from README.

### Changed
- **Canonical ACL overlap remediation now prints a green `REMEDIATED:` status line per OU** instead of a yellow `WARNING`; the overlap detail (DN + principal) is retained in the result's `Warnings` for audit (`Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl.ps1`).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Non-canonical domain-root DACL hard-stops Deploy and Audit with `-SkipRootCanonicalCheck` audit workaround (BUG-006)**: `Test-TierModelCanonicalAcl` and a `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` gate hard-stop `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` and `Audit-TierModel.ps1` (all deployment modes, zero actions) when the domain root DACL is not in canonical form — a non-canonical order (e.g., explicit Allow before explicit Deny) triggers a .NET `System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.ObjectSecurity.AddAccessRule` exception. This is a prerequisite failure, not a deployable bug. The gate is detect-only (never rewrites ACLs); the operator resolves manually using ADUC Reorder or the new `Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl` cmdlet (added in this release). `Audit-TierModel.ps1` has an escape hatch: pass `-SkipRootCanonicalCheck` so it reports the non-canonical root as a Case 1 audit finding instead of halting, allowing audits to proceed and surface all drift (not just the root ACL). `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` does not pass this switch, so deployments must resolve the root ACL first.
- **OU deployment failure on domains with an inherited Deny ACE above the Tier OUs (issue #41)**: `New-TierModelOu` threw `"This access control list is not in canonical form and therefore cannot be modified"` when disabling security inheritance on a Tier OU promoted the inherited Deny to an explicit copy and wrote it back below existing explicit Allow entries — producing a non-canonical DACL. The fix rewrites OU creation as a **phased flow**: Phase 2 disables inheritance via a DC-pinned `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols` write, then immediately reads the DACL back and checks canonical order. If the DACL is non-canonical (which it is on essentially every disable-inheritance OU under an inherited-Deny condition), the new `Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl` primitive re-sorts it before Phase 3 (accidental-deletion protection) runs. This verify-and-remediate step is the load-bearing fix — not a backstop. Lab validation: remediation fired on all disable-inheritance OUs under the Deny condition; deployment completed clean with all OUs canonical; zero remediations when no inherited Deny is present.
- **`-FullDeployment` now hard-stops before the Groups phase on any OU error** (previously only inheritance-verification errors triggered the stop).

### Added
- **`Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl` public cmdlet**: canonical DACL re-sort primitive. Permission-neutral — reorders ACEs into canonical form (explicit Deny → explicit Allow → inherited Deny → inherited Allow) without adding, removing, or modifying any ACE. ACE count before and after is identical. Sort is stable. Supports live DC writes (`-PreferredDc`, `-DistinguishedName`) and offline byte-level sorting (`-SecurityDescriptorBytes`). Also available to operators for manual remediation of a non-canonical domain root or ad-hoc OU repairs.
- **Canonical-ACL audit in `Audit-TierModel.ps1`** (read-only; included in `-OuOnly` and `-FullDeployment`): checks the domain root and each Tier OU for canonical DACL order and surfaces structured drift findings:
  - **Case 1** (`AuditNonCanonicalAclDomainRoot`) — domain root is non-canonical; this is the pre-flight blocker. Operator resolves manually (ADUC Reorder or `Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl`) before deploying.
  - **Case 2** (`AuditNonCanonicalAclTierOu`) — a Tier OU is non-canonical; indicates a failed or pre-fix deployment. Operator deletes the OU and redeploys.
- **Deploy INFO line**: `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` now reports a non-interrupting summary at the end of the OU-creation phase: `Canonical remediation: N OU DACL(s) auto-corrected during disable-inheritance.` (`N = 0` when no inherited Deny is present; `N > 0` — typically equal to the number of disable-inheritance OUs — when one is present).
- **`-SkipRootCanonicalCheck` switch on `Test-TierModelPrerequisites`**: lets `Audit-TierModel.ps1` report a non-canonical domain root as a Case 1 audit finding instead of halting. `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` does not pass this switch, so the domain-root pre-flight gate remains fatal for deployments.

### Changed
- Module version 1.3.0 → **1.3.1** (+1 exported cmdlet: `Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl`).

### Tests
- New `tests/Unit.CanonicalAclRepair.Tests.ps1` (`Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl` — ByBytes offline: return shape, all-four-rank sort, CommonAce-before-ObjectAce sub-order, already-canonical, multiset-preservation, stability, idempotency, Deny/Allow overlap warning, DistinguishedName passthrough, multiple-violation, roundtrip; ByServer mocked offline) and `tests/Unit.CanonicalAclAudit.Tests.ps1` (`Invoke-CanonicalAclAudit` — Case 1, Case 2, all-canonical, mix/error/exception/skip paths, return shape). Additions to `tests/Unit.Prerequisites.Tests.ps1` (+5: `-SkipRootCanonicalCheck` gate), `tests/Unit.OuOperations.Tests.ps1` (Phase 2 verify-and-remediate path), and `tests/Integration.Deploy.Tests.ps1` (canonical-remediation INFO line, N=0/N>0 scenarios). Full suite: **1,627 automated tests passing** under Pester 5.x; aggregate command coverage **≈89%** (`Repair-TierModelCanonicalAcl.ps1` 95.4%, `New-TierModelOu.ps1` 84.9%; live-LDAP ByServer paths exempt per existing team precedent).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **`-EnableAuditing` deployment parameter** on `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` (issue #38). Configures an Active Directory **domain-root object-auditing SACL** (trustee Everyone/S-1-1-0, Success, All-inheritance, 9 rights) that feeds the Microsoft Sentinel Tier Model monitoring solution. Runs standalone (`Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -EnableAuditing -ConfirmApply`) or with `-FullDeployment -EnableAuditing`. Mutually exclusive with the `-*Only` switches. Requires `SeSecurityPrivilege`.
- Four new module cmdlets (exported from TierModel 1.3.0): `Get-TierModelAuditRule` (planner), `New-TierModelAuditRule` (applier, idempotent UNION-converge — preserves out-of-scope ACEs), `Test-TierModelAuditRule` (drift detection with granular per-right PASS/FAIL), `Get-TierModelAuditRuleFd` (FullDeployment wrapper).
- New config `config/tiermodel-audit.json` (domain-root audit rule) + `domainAuditRule` schema segment in `config/tiermodel.schema.json`.
- **Second confirmation gate:** when `-EnableAuditing` is combined with `-ConfirmApply`, an auditing-impact warning + 'Y' prompt is shown FIRST (event-log volume acknowledgement), then the standard deployment 'Y'.
- `-EnableAuditing` support in `Audit-TierModel.ps1` (mirrors the deployment scope) with granular per-right ✅/❌ output aligned to the GPO URA validation model.
- Documentation: new "Step 11: Configure Domain-Root Auditing" in the Detailed Deployment Guide; Sentinel Monitoring guide updated to document the two-part requirement (the `-EnableAuditing` SACL AND the default-linked `*- Tier 0 DCs Advanced Audit Policy - Computer` GPO).

### Changed
- Module version 1.2.3 → **1.3.0** (+4 exported cmdlets).
- Test runner `tests/Invoke-AllTests.ps1` now hard-pins execution to Pester 5.x and blocks Pester 6.x from binding (6.x has breaking changes not yet supported).

### Removed
- Deleted the legacy standalone `optional/Enable-TierModelAuditing.ps1` — its functionality is now built into `Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -EnableAuditing`.

### Tests
- New `tests/Unit.AuditRuleOperations.Tests.ps1` (47 unit tests) plus `-EnableAuditing` integration coverage in the Audit and Deploy suites. Full suite: **1,533 automated tests passing** under Pester 5.x; overall command coverage **89.65%** (new audit cmdlets 84–100%; `Audit-TierModel.ps1` 85.9%, `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` 81.53%).

## [1.2.3] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Non-canonical root ACL pre-flight check** (`Test-TierModelCanonicalAcl`) and a `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` gate that hard-stop Deploy and Audit (all modes, zero objects) with a friendly message when the domain root DACL is not in canonical form. Detect-only — never rewrites ACLs.
- **New documentation page:** Canonical ACLs (`docs/canonical-acl.md`) — explains the condition, the ADUC Reorder fix, effective-permission impact, DC backup guidance, and when to open a Microsoft support case.

### Changed
- The non-blocking Pester 6.x side-by-side advisory now records to `EnvironmentSnapshot.PesterAdvisory` instead of `Remediation`, so it no longer appears in unrelated Deploy/Audit fail-fast output.

### Tests
- Added 26 unit tests (`Unit.CanonicalAcl.Tests.ps1` + canonical-ACL gate tests in `Unit.Prerequisites.Tests.ps1`). Full suite: 1,461 automated tests passing under Pester 5.x; docs-scope coverage 88.74%.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **English-language enforcement (#23)**: `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` now fails fast — before any deployment or audit change — when the environment is not English (`en-US`). Two unconditional checks run up front and are inherited by both `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` and `Audit-TierModel.ps1`:
  - **Host operating system** — reads the local machine's static `InstallLanguage` LCID (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Language`) and requires an English variant (primary language `0x09`, e.g. en-US/en-GB). Runs after the elevation check and **before** the Pester/module checks, and returns immediately on a non-English host so the operator is never asked to install modules on an unsupported OS.
  - **Active Directory** — resolves three well-known groups by SID (Domain Admins `<DomainSID>-512`, Server Operators `S-1-5-32-549`, Account Operators `S-1-5-32-548`) and requires each directory `Name` to be its English value. Child-domain safe (no Enterprise/Schema Admins); names are read from AD (never client-side SID translation, which the local OS would localize into a false pass). A confirmed localized name always fails closed even if another well-known group cannot be resolved.
  - Both checks emit friendly `Errors`/`Remediation` and record diagnostics in `EnvironmentSnapshot` (`HostInstallLanguage`, `HostOsEnglish`, `AdLanguageEnglish`, `AdLanguageMismatches`, …).
- **Documentation**: new `docs/language-support.md` documenting the English-only requirement, the 18 fully-localized Windows Server languages that are detected and stopped, and a future community-localization roadmap. Prerequisite notes added to the README, the quick/detailed deployment guides, and the FAQ.

### Notes
- No configuration changes are required and English (`en-US`) deployments and audits are unaffected (full suite: **1,435** automated tests passing; module scope ~91% coverage). Non-English environments are a documented, unsupported scenario — see `docs/language-support.md`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **OU and GPO ACLs now bind to the preferred DC (BUG-001)**: `New-TierModelOuAcl` bound to the target OU with a serverless path (`[ADSI]"LDAP://$targetOUPath"`), which connects to a random DC — in multi-DC environments successive ACL delegations could land on different DCs, causing replication-dependent inconsistency. It now binds via `"LDAP://$DomainController/$targetOUPath"` (the `-PreferredDc` passed through the pipeline), matching the MSA/gMSA/dMSA ACL cmdlets. The same serverless-bind pattern in `New-TierModelGpo` (the GPO Deny-Apply ACL / GPC bind) was fixed to `"LDAP://$DomainController/CN={...}"` so every ACL — OU and GPO — targets the same DC.
- **`-UserOnly` output now aligns with `-GroupOnly` (BUG-002)**: running `Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -UserOnly` against a domain without the Tier Model OUs/Groups now shows the same sections as every other scope parameter — `Analyzing User requirements...`, a `User Plan Summary`, and the specific `Dependency Errors:` list (each missing OU/Group) — with the `=== Deployment Plan ===` section showing only the generic "Resolve all dependency errors" line. Previously `-UserOnly` called `Invoke-UserDeployment -Silent`, which hid the summary and the dependency-error listing (only the generic resolve line appeared under an otherwise empty heading). The fix runs `Invoke-UserDeployment` non-Silent like `-GroupOnly`, while suppressing per-user "User exists" noise via `Get-TierModelUser -Silent` for parity with the Group path.
- **Windows LAPS FullDeployment planning no longer shows red "missing GPO" errors (BUG-005)**: during `-FullDeployment ... -IncludeWinLaps` preview (without `-ConfirmApply`) against an unprepared domain, a missing LAPS GPO is now silently non-blocking (the GPO is created by the earlier GPO phase). Instead of red `Required GPO ... does not exist` errors, the plan lists each LAPS GPO that will be configured as a yellow `■ Configure : <gpoName>` action, matching the format of the other planned actions. Only the 6 decryptor-configured GPOs are listed; the DC LAPS GPO retains the DSRM default (Domain Admins) by design and is not decryptor-configured in this phase. The FD planner's group resolution was also fixed so that, against an unprepared domain (where `Get-ADGroup -Filter` returns no match without throwing), the `Create ACL` principals and the decryptor `Configure` actions render with best-effort estimated names instead of being blank/omitted (resolved for real at apply time). The standalone `-IncludeWinLaps` path keeps the strict GPO pre-existence requirement (earlier phases do not run there).
- **Pester version gate loosened to any 5.x, with side-by-side 6.x support (BUG-007)**: CI and `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` previously pinned Pester to the exact reference version (`5.7.1`), which blocked otherwise-valid 5.x releases from running or deploying. The gate now accepts any Pester **5.x** release (major-version match) while still blocking **6.x**, whose breaking changes (new mock engine / `Should-*` assertions) broke 44 test cases.
  - CI installs Pester with `-MinimumVersion 5.0.0 -MaximumVersion 5.99.99`; `config/dependencies.json` keeps `5.7.1` as the tested reference version.
  - `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` now accepts a supported 5.x release even when an unsupported newer major (e.g. 6.x) is installed **side-by-side** — this does not block deployment. It emits a non-blocking note that PowerShell auto-loads the highest version, so the 5.x line must be imported explicitly (`Import-Module Pester -MaximumVersion 5.99.99`). It fails only when no 5.x release is present.
  - `tests/Invoke-AllTests.ps1` now selects and explicitly imports the highest installed Pester 5.x so local/lab test runs use the supported version even when 6.x is installed alongside it.
- **dMSA/gMSA/Windows LAPS prerequisites now fail fast, before any deployment phase (BUG-003)**: previously `-FullDeployment -IncludeDmsa` on a domain below Domain Functional Level 2025 ran the entire standard deployment and only surfaced the dMSA requirement as a confusing `attribute 'msDS-DelegatedManagedServiceAccount' not found in schema` planner error at Phase 9. A dMSA DFL critical pre-flight gate now fails fast with a clean message right after module load, and the `-Include*` switches are routed through the up-front `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` call so gMSA (KDS root key), Windows LAPS (schema), and dMSA prerequisites all block before any phase in both `-FullDeployment` and standalone modes. The dMSA DFL message is friendly (no redundant schema-version error), and the DFL-only check is confirmed correct for the single-domain Tier Model (Forest FL 2025 is required only for cross-domain/cross-forest dMSA, which the Tier Model never performs).
- **Windows LAPS audit now detects unexpected (extra) LAPS delegations (BUG-004)**: `Test-TierModelWinLapsAcl` documented an `UnexpectedAcl` finding but never emitted one — it only verified that the configured Read/Reset principals were present, never that extra principals were absent. It now flags any LAPS extended-right holder that is not a configured Read/Reset group and not a well-known/admin principal as `UnexpectedAcl` (yellow ⚠️, counted as drift), mirroring the MSA/gMSA/dMSA audits.
- **`-Include*` prerequisite checks resolve `config/dependencies.json` from any working directory (BUG-008)**: the `$prereqSplat` hashtables for the MSA/gMSA/dMSA/WinLaps prerequisite checks omitted `DependenciesPath`, so `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` fell back to its cwd-relative default and failed with "Dependencies file not found" when the script was launched by absolute path from a different directory. Both splats now pass an absolute `$PSScriptRoot`-based `DependenciesPath`, matching the primary prerequisite call.
- **Consistent fail-fast prerequisite messages across Deploy and Audit**: a shared `Write-TierModelFailFast` helper renders every up-front gate (PowerShell version, dMSA DFL, and the general prerequisite failure) identically — indented message with no `Prerequisites not met:` header and no `ERROR:` prefix, a blank-line-separated `Remediation steps:` block, and the closing `Deploy script completed.` / `Audit script completed.` line. Duplicated resolution text was removed from the Windows LAPS schema errors, every previously-bare dMSA prerequisite error gained a remediation step, and `Audit-TierModel.ps1` gained a matching PowerShell-version gate.
- **OU "Block GPO Inheritance" is now verified and retried during deployment (BUG-010)**: creating an OU with `blockGpoInheritance` (or `disableInheritance`) previously called `Set-GPInheritance -IsBlocked Yes` (or `Set-Acl` protection) once and reported success as long as the call did not throw — but the change intermittently did not persist (a silent no-op, ~10% per OU on a fast run), leaving a tier boundary unblocked while the deployment still reported success. `New-TierModelOu` now reads back `Get-GPInheritance` (and the ACL's `AreAccessRulesProtected`) on the same DC and retries up to 4 times with backoff until the setting is verified; if it still cannot be confirmed it records a human-readable error ("Block GPO Inheritance flag was not set for OU 'X'…") instead of a false success. In `-FullDeployment`, an unverified OU inheritance setting hard-stops the run before the Groups phase so a tier boundary is never silently left open. The logic remains create-only — existing/live OUs are never modified (remediate drift via change control and confirm with the audit script).
- **Windows LAPS audit no longer false-flags tier admins that hold OU full control (BUG-009)**: `Test-TierModelWinLapsAcl`'s `UnexpectedAcl` detection (added in BUG-004) uses `Find-LapsADExtendedRights`, which resolves a principal's *effective* LAPS read — including access granted implicitly by `GenericAll` (full control). Because the Tier Model's own OU-management delegation grants tier admin groups (e.g. `Tier0Admins`/`Tier1Admins`) `GenericAll` on their Member-Server OUs, every audit flagged them as unexpected LAPS readers even though they hold no *explicit* ms-LAPS delegation. The audit now collects the OU's `GenericAll` (Allow) holders from the same DACL it already reads for SELF detection and excludes them from the unexpected-holder check, so a genuinely unexpected *explicit* LAPS reader is still flagged while `GenericAll`-derived effective access is not. Full-control drift remains covered separately by the OU ACL audit. (Lab-validated: the two recurring `Tier0Admins`/`Tier1Admins` warnings are gone and an injected explicit LAPS holder is still detected.)
- **Clean deployment no longer reports phantom "Skipped" items (BUG-011)**: a brand-new `-FullDeployment … -ConfirmApply` reported `Skipped: 4` despite creating everything with zero real skips. The User and OuAcl result objects built their `Applied`/`Skipped` arrays with `@(1..$executionResult.Skipped | ForEach-Object {…})`; when the count is `0`, PowerShell's `1..0` is a **descending** range (`{1, 0}`, two elements), so each of those two phases emitted 2 phantom "Skipped" entries → `Skipped: 4`. All four `1..$n` ranges (the User and OuAcl `Applied` and `Skipped` builders) are now guarded with `if ($n -gt 0)` so a zero count yields an empty array; real applied/skipped counts are unchanged.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

#### Windows LAPS Support
- **Windows LAPS ACL Cmdlets**: `Get-TierModelWinLapsAcl`, `Get-TierModelWinLapsAclFd`, `New-TierModelWinLapsAcl`, and `Test-TierModelWinLapsAcl` for deploying and auditing Windows LAPS DACL delegations (Self / Read / Reset permissions per target OU)
- **Windows LAPS Decryptor Audit**: `Test-TierModelWinLapsDecryptor` verifies the `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` GPO registry policy on each non-DC LAPS GPO
- **`-IncludeWinLaps` switch**: added to `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` (standalone and full-deployment Phase 10, after MSA/gMSA/dMSA) and `Audit-TierModel.ps1` (opt-in ACL + decryptor drift detection)
- **Configuration**: `config/tiermodel-winlaps.json` defining 7 LAPS ACL delegations plus per-OU decryptor group mapping
- **GPO Decryptor Configuration**: deployment configures the authorized password decryptor (`ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal`) on the 6 non-DC LAPS GPOs so the correct tier group can decrypt managed passwords (Domain Controllers retain the DSRM default of Domain Admins)
- **Prerequisite Validation**: extended `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` with the Windows LAPS schema hard-stop and the OU / group / LAPS-GPO dependency checks
- **Windows LAPS only**: uses `ms-LAPS-*` attributes exclusively — never legacy Microsoft LAPS (`ms-Mcs-AdmPwd*` / `AdmPwd.PS`)

### Changed
- Removed the superseded manual `optional/Deploy-WindowsLaps.ps1` (functionality replaced by `Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps`)

- Full suite: 1,401 automated tests passing; 90.92% module code coverage

### Documentation
- Documented `-IncludeWinLaps` across `README.md` and `docs/` (detailed deployment guide, deployment methodology, cmdlet architecture, drift detection, FAQ, test coverage, test tag matrix), matching the existing MSA/gMSA/dMSA "Optional Feature" pattern
