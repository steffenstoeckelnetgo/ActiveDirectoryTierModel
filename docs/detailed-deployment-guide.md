# Detailed Deployment Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step deployment workflow using scoped deployment parameters. Use this approach when you need granular control over the deployment process or want to deploy components incrementally.

For a streamlined full deployment workflow, see the [Quick Deployment Guide](quick-deployment-guide.md).

> **Supported environment:** any language — the **host OS** (the machine you run the scripts from) and **Active Directory** may each be installed in any language. Prerequisite validation records both languages as diagnostics and never stops on them. `en-US` and `de-DE` are the regression-tested combinations. See [Language Support](language-support.md).

## Overview

This detailed approach deploys Tier Model components one type at a time, following the proper dependency order:

1. **Organizational Units (OUs)** - Foundation hierarchy
2. **Security Groups** - Required for ACL delegations and GPO filtering
3. **User Accounts** - Service accounts and administrative users
4. **OU ACL Delegations** - Permissions and rights delegation
5. **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** - Policy configuration and linking
6. **ADMX Templates** - Administrative template imports

Each component follows a three-step pattern:
1. **Plan** - Preview changes without applying them
2. **Deploy** - Execute the deployment with `-ConfirmApply`
3. **Audit** - Verify compliance and detect drift

## Step 1: Deploy Organizational Units

### 1.1 Plan OU Deployment

---

## Step 7: Deploy MSA ACL Delegations (Optional)

This step is optional and only required if you need to manage Managed Service Account (MSA) permissions using the Tier Model. Enable with `-IncludeMsa` switch.

### 7.1 Plan MSA ACL Deployment
Review what MSA ACL delegations will be applied:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeMsa -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

---

## Step 8: Deploy gMSA ACL Delegations (Optional)

This step is optional and only required if you need to manage Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) permissions using the Tier Model. Enable with `-IncludeGmsa` switch.

### 8.1 Plan gMSA ACL Deployment

- No drift detected

---

## Step 10: Deploy Windows LAPS ACL Delegations (Optional)

This step is optional and only required if you use Windows LAPS encrypted-password storage. It deploys 7 ACL delegations (Self, Read, and Reset permissions per target OU) **and** sets the `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` registry value on the 6 non-DC LAPS GPOs so the correct tier group can decrypt managed passwords. Enable with `-IncludeWinLaps` switch.

> ⚠️ **Windows LAPS only** — this feature exclusively uses the Windows LAPS APIs (`ms-LAPS-*` attributes). Legacy Microsoft LAPS (`ms-Mcs-AdmPwd*`, `AdmPwd.PS`) is never referenced or modified.

### Prerequisites

Before running this step, the following must already exist in Active Directory:

| Dependency | Required by |
|-----------|-------------|
| All Tier Model OUs | ACL delegation targets |
| All Tier Model Groups | Read/Reset permission principals |
| All 7 Windows LAPS GPOs | Decryptor configuration (GPO existence only, not links) |
| Windows LAPS schema extension (`ms-LAPS-Password` attribute class) | Schema gate — **tool stops with a friendly error if absent; it never extends the schema itself** |

Missing OUs or groups produce a **Dependency Errors** listing and halt the plan. Missing GPOs are flagged per entry.

### 10.1 Plan Windows LAPS ACL Deployment
Review what delegations will be applied:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- 7 target OUs listed with their read/reset group assignments
- 6 `ConfigureLapsDecryptor` actions showing GPO name → decryptor principal
- Domain Controllers OU shows Self + Read/Reset for Domain Admins (no decryptor — DSRM always uses Domain Admins)
- No changes applied to Active Directory

### 10.2 Deploy Windows LAPS ACLs
Execute the Windows LAPS ACL deployment:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

**Expected Output:**
- 7 × Self-permission, Read-permission, Reset-permission delegations applied
- 6 GPOs configured with `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` (NETBIOS\sAMAccountName format)
- Deployment is idempotent — re-runs skip already-configured delegations and decryptor entries
- Deployment summary

### 10.3 Audit Windows LAPS ACLs
Verify Windows LAPS ACL and decryptor compliance:

```powershell
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- All 7 LAPS ACL delegations compliant (Self, Read, Reset present on each OU)
- All 6 GPO decryptor values compliant (correct `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` set)
- No drift detected
- Findings show `Compliant` for each delegation entry

> **Note on tier isolation:** `ADPasswordEncryptionPrincipal` is a single principal per GPO. This means Tier 0 Admins can decrypt Tier 0 PAW passwords, but **cannot** decrypt Tier 1 or Tier 2 PAW passwords — each tier's admins decrypt only their own tier. This is intentional per-tier isolation enforced by CNG-DPAPI; GenericAll on a lower-tier PAW OU does not grant decryption.

---

## Deploying Windows LAPS as Part of Full Deployment

`-IncludeWinLaps` composes cleanly with `-FullDeployment`. The Windows LAPS phase runs **after** MSA → gMSA → dMSA (Phase 10):

```powershell
# Plan full deployment including Windows LAPS
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com

# Apply full deployment including Windows LAPS
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply

# Audit everything including Windows LAPS
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

> **Opt-in:** A plain `-FullDeployment` (without `-IncludeWinLaps`) does **not** deploy or audit Windows LAPS. You must explicitly add `-IncludeWinLaps` to include it.

---

## Step 11: Configure Domain-Root Auditing (Optional)

This step configures domain-root object auditing for Microsoft Sentinel monitoring. It deploys a SACL (System Access Control List) audit rule on the domain root to generate the Security events that feed the Sentinel Tier Model solution. Enable with `-EnableAuditing` switch.

> **Sentinel monitoring prerequisite:** This step addresses the SACL component of the two-part monitoring requirement. The DC Advanced Audit Policy GPO (`*- Tier 0 DCs Advanced Audit Policy - Computer`, linked by default) is the second piece — it **enables** event generation on each Domain Controller. Both the SACL **and** the GPO link must be in place for Sentinel to receive events. See [Sentinel Monitoring — Before you begin](sentinel-monitoring.md#before-you-begin) for the full context.

### Prerequisites

Before running this step, the following must already be in place:

| Dependency | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Tier Model deployed | The auditing configuration assumes Tier Model groups and OUs exist |
| **SeSecurityPrivilege** (Domain Admin) | Writing SACL audit rules requires the `SeSecurityPrivilege` privilege; Domain Admin holds this |
| Preferred DC binding | SACL reads and writes should bind to a single preferred DC; replication handles convergence (allow 15 minutes) |

### 11.1 Plan Domain-Root Auditing

Review the audit SACL that will be applied to the domain root:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -EnableAuditing -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- Phase 11: Domain Audit Rule (SACL) shown with action `■ Add audit rule on domain root`
- Audit rule details: Trustee `Everyone (S-1-1-0)`, AuditFlags `Success`, InheritanceType `All`, Rights = 9 (Property Read, Property Write, Delete Child, List Child, Extended Right, Delete, Delete Tree, Change Owner, Change Permission)
- No prompts, no changes applied to Active Directory
- Deployment summary

### 11.2 Deploy Domain-Root Auditing

Execute the audit SACL deployment:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -EnableAuditing -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

**Expected Output (Two-Y confirmation flow):**
1. **Auditing-specific confirmation prompt:** "This will add/modify SACL audit rules on the domain root. Auditing increases Security event-log volume. Confirm? [Y/N]" — Type **Y** to accept auditing impact warning.
2. **Standard deployment confirmation prompt:** "Apply changes? [Y/N]" — Type **Y** to deploy the SACL audit rule.
- SACL audit rule written to the domain root
- Replication begins immediately; converges to all DCs within 15 minutes
- Deployment summary

### 11.3 Audit Domain-Root Auditing

Verify audit SACL compliance:

```powershell
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -EnableAuditing -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- Phase 11: Domain Audit Rule (SACL) shown with per-right status
- Each of the 9 target rights shown with ✅ (compliant) or ❌ (missing)
- Audit rule details: existing ACE composition, status (Complete, Partial, or Absent)
- No drift detected if all 9 rights are compliant
- Audit summary

### Composing -EnableAuditing with Full Deployment

`-EnableAuditing` composes cleanly with `-FullDeployment`:

```powershell
# Plan full deployment including domain-root auditing
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -EnableAuditing -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com

# Apply full deployment including domain-root auditing
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -EnableAuditing -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply

# Audit everything including domain-root auditing
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -EnableAuditing -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

> **Mutual exclusion:** `-EnableAuditing` is mutually exclusive with other `-*Only` switches (`OuOnly`, `GroupOnly`, `UserOnly`, etc.). To deploy auditing alongside targeted component steps, use `-FullDeployment -EnableAuditing` instead.

> **Idempotency:** The audit rule converges to the canonical state (all 9 rights present in a single SACL entry) and is fully idempotent. Re-running `Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -EnableAuditing -ConfirmApply` on an already-audited domain root skips the write and exits cleanly.

---



```powershell
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

**Expected Output:**
- All components compliant across all categories
- Zero high-severity findings
- Complete audit report

## Enable the Account Restrictions GPO (Before Go-Live)

Before you begin using the Tier Model in production, enable the domain-root **`*- Tier Model Account Restrictions`** GPO. It ships **link-disabled** by design and is the control that prevents built-in Tier Model groups and well-known Tier 0 groups from logging on to endpoints outside the Tier Model.

> ⚠️ **Understand this GPO before enabling it.** Once linked, it applies to **all production endpoints outside the Tier Model — both client and server — but not domain controllers** (Domain Controllers and RODCs are explicitly excluded from the GPO). Because it is linked at the domain root, you must evaluate any OU with Block Inheritance or an existing Enforced GPO so that it reaches every such endpoint at priority 1.
>
> See **[GPO Management Guidance — Enable the Account Restrictions GPO First](gpo-management-guidance.md#2-enable-the-account-restrictions-gpo-first)** for the full explanation, including the block-inheritance and enforcement evaluation.

## Troubleshooting

### Component Dependencies

If a deployment step fails, verify dependencies are in place:
- **Groups** require OUs to exist
- **Users** require OUs and Groups to exist
- **OU ACLs** require OUs and Groups to exist
- **MSA ACLs** (Optional) require MSA objects and Groups to exist
- **gMSA ACLs** (Optional) require gMSA objects and Groups to exist
- **dMSA ACLs** (Optional) require dMSA objects and Groups to exist
- **Windows LAPS ACLs** (Optional) require OUs, Groups, and all 7 Windows LAPS GPOs to exist; Windows LAPS schema extension (`ms-LAPS-Password`) must be present
- **GPOs** require OUs to exist for linking

### Redeployment

If issues occur, you can safely re-run any deployment step. The deployment scripts are idempotent and will skip existing objects:

```powershell
# Re-run a specific component deployment
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -GroupOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

### Audit Failures

If an audit step reports drift or non-compliance:
1. Review the audit findings
2. Identify the specific discrepancies
3. Re-run the deployment for that component to remediate
4. Re-audit to verify compliance

## When to Use This Approach

Use this detailed step-by-step approach when:
- Deploying to production for the first time
- Validating each component before proceeding
- Troubleshooting specific component issues
- Learning the deployment process
- Meeting change control requirements for incremental changes

For routine deployments or updates, consider using the [Quick Deployment Guide](quick-deployment-guide.md) with `-FullDeployment`.

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
- Schedule regular audits to detect configuration drift
- Document any manual changes made outside automation
- Review audit reports periodically for compliance monitoring

For additional documentation, see:
- [Quick Deployment Guide](quick-deployment-guide.md)
- [Deployment Methodology](deployment-methodology.md)
- [Drift Detection Details](drift-detection-details.md)
- [GPO Management Strategy](gpo-management-strategy.md)

## Appendix: Troubleshooting Diagnostic Output

Use the v2.1.0 diagnostic switches when a normal deployment or audit does not give enough information to understand what happened during a run. Start with verbose output for most operator questions. Use debug output only when verbose output is not enough, because debug mode is noticeably slower and much noisier by design.

Use `-EnableVerbose` and `-EnableDebug` on `Deploy-TierModel.ps1` or `Audit-TierModel.ps1`. These names are deliberate: they raise the script preference variables while leaving PowerShell's common `-Verbose` and `-Debug` parameters available and unshadowed.

For the full logging reference, see [Tier Model Logging](tiermodel-logging.md).

### Escalation ladder

Replace `-GposOnly` with the component switch you are troubleshooting. For a deployment plan, omit `-ConfirmApply`.

1. **Normal run** — use first when you expect the standard summary to be enough.

    ```powershell
    .\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -GposOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
    .\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -GposOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
    ```

2. **Verbose run** — use for most stalls, unexpected skips, or unclear audit output.

    ```powershell
    .\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -GposOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply -EnableVerbose
    .\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -GposOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -EnableVerbose
    ```

3. **Verbose + debug run** — last rung. Use only when you need a deeper support artifact and accept the slower, noisier run.

    ```powershell
    .\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -GposOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply -EnableVerbose -EnableDebug
    .\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -GposOnly -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -EnableVerbose -EnableDebug
    ```

### Where diagnostic output is written

Either diagnostic switch automatically enables `-Logging`; the script announces that logging was enabled for the diagnostic run. Diagnostic files are written under a `Debug\` subfolder beside the script, separate from the normal log output.

A PowerShell transcript starts only when **both** `-EnableVerbose` and `-EnableDebug` are supplied together. A single diagnostic switch does not start a transcript. The transcript adds a console-level record of the run, including prompts, command output, warnings, verbose messages, and debug messages that crossed the console.

Deploy and Audit do **not** apply log retention to normal or diagnostic log files. Unlike `optional\Update-TierModelMembership.ps1`, which keeps 7 days for scheduled operation, Deploy and Audit are normally run once, interactively, to confirm a deployment or audit result. Collect or remove the diagnostic files when the investigation is complete.

> 🔴 **WARNING — transcripts are unredacted.**
>
> A transcript captures whatever crossed the console. Review the transcript yourself before attaching it to a public GitHub issue, support case, email, or chat. Do not share it until you are satisfied it contains no sensitive tenant, domain, account, path, or operational data.

### Symptom → what to try

| Symptom | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| A deployment or audit phase appears to stall or sits on one phase longer than expected | Re-run that same scoped command with `-EnableVerbose` first. Verbose output usually shows the current phase, object, or validation step. Escalate to both switches only if the verbose run still leaves the stall unclear. |
| An expected OU, group, user, GPO, or delegation does not appear to have been created | Re-run the same deployment scope with `-EnableVerbose`, then audit the same scope with `-EnableVerbose`. Compare the standard summary with the `Debug\` output to confirm whether the item was planned, skipped, failed, or still awaiting a dependency. |
| An audit result looks wrong or does not match what you see in Active Directory or Group Policy Management | Re-run the audit with `-EnableVerbose` against the same `-PreferredDc`. If the mismatch remains and you need to provide evidence for review, run both switches together and review the transcript before sharing it. |
| The script says it enabled logging even though you did not pass `-Logging` | This is expected when either diagnostic switch is used. The diagnostic switch auto-enables logging and writes its diagnostic artifacts under `Debug\`. |
| Debug output is slow or extremely noisy | This is expected. `-EnableDebug` raises the debug preference and should be reserved for the final escalation rung, especially when combined with transcript capture. |

### What these switches will not tell you

These switches surface more diagnostic output; they are not a guaranteed root-cause tool. They do not prove why Active Directory or Group Policy accepted, rejected, delayed, or replicated a change. They also do not redact output, replace prerequisite validation, or guarantee that a missing object or unexpected audit result can be explained from a single run.
