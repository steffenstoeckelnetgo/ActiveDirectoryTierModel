# Quick Deployment Guide

This guide provides a streamlined workflow for deploying and auditing the Tier Model in production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the Tier Model, ensure the following requirements are met:

### Environment Requirements
- **PowerShell 7.0 or later** (PowerShell 5.1 is not supported)
- **Domain Admin membership** for deployment operations
- **Network access** to your preferred Domain Controller
- **Any host and directory language** — built-in principals resolve by well-known SID, not by directory name, so the **host OS** (the machine you run the scripts from) and **Active Directory** may each be installed in any language; `en-US` and `de-DE` are regression-tested (see [Language Support](language-support.md))

### Required PowerShell Modules
- `ActiveDirectory` (version 1.0.1.0 or later)
- `GroupPolicy` (version 1.0 or later)
- `Pester` (any 5.x release; Pester 6.x is not yet supported) - Must be obtained from public sources (PowerShell Gallery)

### Installation
Install Pester from the PowerShell Gallery:
```powershell
Install-Module -Name Pester -MinimumVersion 5.0.0 -MaximumVersion 5.99.99 -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
```

### Obtain TierModel
Download the latest TierModel release from GitHub

# Unblock the downloaded zip file
Unblock-File -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\TierModel.zip"

# Extract to C:\
Expand-Archive -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\TierModel.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\" -Force

# Navigate to the TierModel directory
cd C:\TierModel
```

**Note:** The deployment and audit scripts automatically import the TierModel module and validate prerequisites.

## Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Plan the Deployment (Dry-Run)
Run the deploy script in **planning mode** (default behavior) to preview all changes without applying them:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

This will:
- Validate prerequisites
- Generate a deployment plan showing all proposed changes
- Display adds, updates, and potential issues
- **NOT apply any changes** to Active Directory

Review the output carefully to ensure the planned changes are correct.

### Step 2: Execute the Deployment
After reviewing the plan, apply the changes using the `-ConfirmApply` parameter:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
```

This will deploy all Tier Model components in the correct dependency order:
1. Organizational Units (OUs)
2. Security Groups
3. User Accounts
4. OU ACL Delegations
5. Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
6. ADMX Administrative Templates

> **Optional features** (MSA/gMSA/dMSA ACL delegations, Windows LAPS ACL delegations + GPO decryptor) are **not** included in a standard `-FullDeployment` — add the appropriate switches to enable them:
> ```powershell
> .\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -IncludeMsa -IncludeGmsa -IncludeDmsa -IncludeWinLaps -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply
> ```

### Step 3: Audit the Deployment
After deployment completes, run a full audit to verify compliance and detect any drift:

```powershell
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com
```

This will:
- Check all deployed components against the configuration
- Identify any drift from the desired state
- Generate a compliance report
- Highlight any manual intervention required

### Step 4: Enable the Account Restrictions GPO (before go-live)

Before you begin using the Tier Model, enable the domain-root **`*- Tier Model Account Restrictions`** GPO. It ships **link-disabled** and is the control that stops built-in Tier Model groups and well-known Tier 0 groups from logging on to endpoints outside the Tier Model.

> ⚠️ **Understand this GPO before you enable it.** Once linked, it applies to **all production endpoints outside the Tier Model — both clients and servers — but not domain controllers** (Domain Controllers and RODCs are explicitly excluded). Because it is linked at the domain root, evaluate any OU with Block Inheritance or an existing Enforced GPO so that it reaches every such endpoint at priority 1. See **[GPO Management Guidance — Enable the Account Restrictions GPO First](gpo-management-guidance.md#2-enable-the-account-restrictions-gpo-first)** for the full explanation.

## Expected Results

### Successful Deployment
- All components created or updated as specified
- Zero errors in the deployment log
- Audit shows full compliance with no drift detected

### First Audit After Deployment
The audit should report:
- **All components compliant** with the Tier Model configuration
- **No drift findings** (or minimal informational findings)
- **Zero high-severity issues**

If the audit identifies drift immediately after deployment, review the deployment logs and investigate the discrepancies.

## Optional: Enable Logging and Diagnostics

For troubleshooting or audit trails, enable detailed logging:

```powershell
# Deployment with logging
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply -Logging

# Audit with logging
.\Audit-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -Logging
```

Logs are saved to the current directory or the path specified by `-LogPath`.

### Escalate a misbehaving run

When normal output is not enough, re-run the same deployment with TierModel diagnostics enabled:

```powershell
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -FullDeployment -PreferredDc DC01.contoso.com -ConfirmApply -EnableVerbose -EnableDebug -LogPath "C:\Logs"
```

- `-EnableVerbose` adds higher-level progress and decision detail.
- `-EnableDebug` adds lower-level diagnostics. Expect slower execution and noisier console output; that noise is accepted during a diagnostic run.
- Diagnostic files are written to a `Debug\` subfolder under the resolved log directory, separate from the normal log.
- Deploy and Audit keep no rolling retention history. They run once, interactively, to confirm a specific deployment or audit; unlike the scheduled `optional\Update-TierModelMembership.ps1`, they do not keep 7 days of logs.

> 🔴 **Unredacted transcript warning:** When `-EnableVerbose -EnableDebug` are supplied together, PowerShell starts a transcript in `Debug\`. The transcript is **unredacted** and captures whatever crosses the console. Review and redact it before sharing; never paste an unredacted transcript into a public issue.

See [Tier Model Logging](tiermodel-logging.md) for the full diagnostics model.

## Troubleshooting

### Prerequisites Failed
If `Test-TierModelPrerequisites` reports errors:
- Install PowerShell 7+ from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases
- Verify Domain Admin group membership
- Ensure required AD and GP modules are installed (use RSAT on Windows)
- Ensure the **host OS** (where you run the scripts) and **Active Directory** are English (`en-US`) — non-English environments are not supported (see [Language Support](language-support.md))

### Deployment Errors
- Review error messages in deployment output
- Check logs if `-Logging` was enabled
- Verify JSON configuration syntax and schema compliance
- Ensure the preferred DC is reachable and responsive

### Audit Drift Detected
- Compare audit findings against recent changes
- Review manual interventions that may have occurred outside automation
- Re-run deployment to converge environment back to desired state

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
- Schedule regular audits to detect configuration drift
- Document any manual changes made outside the automation
- Update the configuration JSON for future deployments
- Review audit reports periodically for compliance monitoring
