<#
.SYNOPSIS
Modular TierModel deployment using dedicated cmdlets per entity type.

.DESCRIPTION
Performs TierModel component deployment across all supported entity types: organizational
units, security groups, user accounts, OU ACL delegations, Group Policy Objects, and ADMX
configurations. Also supports optional add-on features: MSA/gMSA/dMSA managed-service-account
ACL delegations (-IncludeMsa / -IncludeGmsa / -IncludeDmsa), Windows LAPS DACL delegations
(-IncludeWinLaps), AD Authentication Policy Silos (-IncludeAuthSilos), and domain-root AD
object auditing for Sentinel monitoring (-EnableAuditing).

Uses a modular cmdlet architecture for maintainability and testing. Default mode is planning
(shows what would change without writing anything). Pass -ConfirmApply to execute.

Scope parameters (-OuOnly, -GroupOnly, etc.) run a single entity type in isolation.
-FullDeployment runs all entity types in dependency order with consolidated reporting.
Optional add-on switches (-Include* / -EnableAuditing) may run standalone or alongside
-FullDeployment, but cannot be combined with any single-scope (-*Only) parameter.

.PARAMETER PreferredDc
The preferred domain controller to use for all Active Directory operations.
Must be accessible and have appropriate permissions for creating AD objects.

.PARAMETER OuOnly
Deploy only organizational units. OU creation and configuration will be performed
based on the TierModel specification. Cannot be combined with -Include* or -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER GroupOnly
Deploy only security groups. Group creation and membership configuration will be
performed. Cannot be combined with -Include* or -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER UserOnly
Deploy only user accounts. User account creation and configuration will be performed.
Cannot be combined with -Include* or -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER GposOnly
Deploy only Group Policy Objects. GPO creation, configuration, and linking will be
performed. Cannot be combined with -Include* or -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER OuAclsOnly
Deploy only OU ACL delegations. Organizational unit access control list delegations
will be applied. Cannot be combined with -Include* or -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER AdmxOnly
Deploy only ADMX template configurations. Administrative template imports and
configurations will be applied. Cannot be combined with -Include* or -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER FullDeployment
Perform comprehensive deployment of all TierModel components in dependency order:
OUs -> Groups -> Users -> OU ACL Delegations -> GPOs -> ADMX -> optional add-ons.
Provides consolidated reporting at completion. Compatible with -Include* and -EnableAuditing.

.PARAMETER ConfirmApply
Execute the deployment plan. Without this switch the script runs in planning mode only,
showing what changes would be made without applying them. When -EnableAuditing is also
specified, two Y confirmations are required: an auditing-specific warning about event log
volume is presented first, followed by the standard deployment confirmation. Both must be
accepted; either cancellation aborts before any changes are made.

.PARAMETER IncludeMsa
Deploy Managed Service Account (MSA) ACL delegations from the tiermodel-msa.json
configuration segment. May be run standalone or combined with -FullDeployment.
Cannot be combined with any -OuOnly, -GroupOnly, -UserOnly, -GposOnly, -OuAclsOnly,
or -AdmxOnly scope parameter.

.PARAMETER IncludeGmsa
Deploy group Managed Service Account (gMSA) ACL delegations from the tiermodel-gmsa.json
configuration segment. May be run standalone or combined with -FullDeployment.
Cannot be combined with any -OuOnly, -GroupOnly, -UserOnly, -GposOnly, -OuAclsOnly,
or -AdmxOnly scope parameter.

.PARAMETER IncludeDmsa
Deploy delegated Managed Service Account (dMSA) ACL delegations from the tiermodel-dmsa.json
configuration segment. Requires Domain Functional Level Windows Server 2025; the script
performs a pre-flight DFL check and fails fast if the requirement is not met.
May be run standalone or combined with -FullDeployment.
Cannot be combined with any -OuOnly, -GroupOnly, -UserOnly, -GposOnly, -OuAclsOnly,
or -AdmxOnly scope parameter.

.PARAMETER IncludeWinLaps
Deploy Windows LAPS DACL delegations (read-password, reset-password, computer self-permission)
from the tiermodel-winlaps.json configuration segment. Requires the Windows LAPS schema
extensions to be present in Active Directory.
May be run standalone or combined with -FullDeployment.
Cannot be combined with any -OuOnly, -GroupOnly, -UserOnly, -GposOnly, -OuAclsOnly,
or -AdmxOnly scope parameter.

.PARAMETER IncludeAuthSilos
Deploy AD Authentication Policies and Authentication Policy Silos from the
tiermodel-authsilos.json configuration segment. Creates 4 policies and 4 silos (one per
administrative tier: Tier 0 Admin, Tier 1 Admin, Tier 2 Admin, Tier 2 EUD) in AUDIT mode
(not enforced). Assigns account and computer membership by expanding the configured
memberAccountGroups and memberComputerGroups. Permanently exempt accounts (domain-join
service accounts and the built-in Administrator/RID-500) are never assigned.
May be run standalone or combined with -FullDeployment.
Cannot be combined with any -OuOnly, -GroupOnly, -UserOnly, -GposOnly, -OuAclsOnly,
or -AdmxOnly scope parameter.

.PARAMETER EnableAuditing
Enable domain-root Active Directory object auditing for Sentinel monitoring. Applies a
canonical SACL audit ACE (Everyone / AuditFlags=Success / InheritanceType=All) covering
nine rights (CreateChild, DeleteChild, WriteProperty, Self, Delete, DeleteTree, WriteDacl,
WriteOwner, ExtendedRight) to the domain root distinguished name. Uses UNION converge logic:
any rights the customer already has on a matching ACE are preserved and our nine are
guaranteed. Requires SeSecurityPrivilege (Domain Admin qualifies).

When combined with -ConfirmApply, prompts a second, auditing-specific Y confirmation BEFORE
the standard deployment confirmation. The warning reads: "Enabling auditing will increase
the events being generated in the Domain Controller Event Logs..." and requires explicit
acceptance that event log sizing and retention are sufficient.

May be run standalone or combined with -FullDeployment.
Cannot be combined with any -OuOnly, -GroupOnly, -UserOnly, -GposOnly, -OuAclsOnly,
or -AdmxOnly scope parameter.

Note: the SACL alone does not generate Security events. The DC advanced-audit GPO
(Directory Service Changes) must also be configured and its link enabled (on by default
in the TierModel GPO set) for Sentinel to receive events.

.PARAMETER AdmlLanguage
The ADML language culture code used when importing ADMX/ADML administrative templates.
Defaults to 'en-US'. Must match the language folder present in the ADMX source path.

.PARAMETER Logging
Enable structured logging to a timestamped file. When specified, all deployment operations
and results are written to a log file in the directory specified by -LogPath (or the current
working directory if -LogPath is omitted).

.PARAMETER LogPath
Directory path where the log file will be created when -Logging is enabled.
The directory will be created automatically if it does not exist.
If not provided, the log file is created in the current working directory.

.PARAMETER OutputFileBase
Base filename for generated log files (without extension or timestamp).
The actual filename will include a timestamp suffix and appropriate extension.
When -Logging is specified without it you are prompted for one; pressing Enter accepts the
default 'Deploy-TierModel' rather than stopping the run.

.PARAMETER EnableVerbose
Enable verbose diagnostic output for troubleshooting. Console output becomes considerably
more detailed and interleaves with the normal progress output - that is expected, and is the
point of the switch. This switch also enables -Logging automatically, so a diagnostic run
always leaves a log file behind; if -OutputFileBase is omitted it defaults to
'Deploy-TierModel' without prompting, keeping a re-run copy-pasteable.
Diagnostic switches change only what is recorded, never what is decided or written to
Active Directory.

.PARAMETER EnableDebug
Enable debug diagnostic output for troubleshooting. As with -EnableVerbose, this also
enables -Logging automatically and makes console output substantially more detailed.
When -EnableVerbose and -EnableDebug are supplied together, a PowerShell transcript is
also started in a 'Debug' folder beneath the resolved log directory, capturing the full
console session.
WARNING: the transcript is NOT redacted. It may contain distinguished names, SIDs, SDDL,
group memberships and other sensitive Tier 0 detail. Review it before sharing it with
anyone, including support.
If a run is interrupted with Ctrl-C the transcript is left open and continues capturing
until the console exits; run Stop-Transcript manually if that happens.
Diagnostic switches change only what is recorded, never what is decided or written to
Active Directory.

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -OuOnly -EnableVerbose
Plan mode with verbose diagnostics. Logging is enabled automatically and written to
Deploy-TierModel-<timestamp>.log in the current directory.

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -FullDeployment -EnableVerbose -EnableDebug -LogPath "C:\Logs"
Full diagnostic escalation: verbose and debug output, automatic logging to C:\Logs, plus an
unredacted transcript in C:\Logs\Debug. Review the transcript before sharing it.

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -OuOnly
Generate a deployment plan for organizational units only (planning mode — no changes made).

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -OuOnly -ConfirmApply -Logging -LogPath "C:\Logs"
Deploy organizational units and write a structured log to C:\Logs.

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -FullDeployment -ConfirmApply -Logging -OutputFileBase "TierModel-Deploy"
Full TierModel deployment (all entity types) with logging to a timestamped file.

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -EnableAuditing
Plan mode: show the domain-root audit rule that would be configured (no changes made).

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -EnableAuditing -ConfirmApply
Apply the domain-root audit SACL standalone. Presents the auditing event-log warning first
(Prompt 1), then the standard deployment confirmation (Prompt 2). Both must be 'Y' to proceed.

.EXAMPLE
.\Deploy-TierModel.ps1 -PreferredDc "DC01.contoso.com" -FullDeployment -EnableAuditing -ConfirmApply
Full deployment including the domain-root audit SACL. Same two-prompt confirmation sequence:
auditing warning (Prompt 1), then deployment confirmation (Prompt 2).

.NOTES
Version: 2.1.0
Requires: TierModel PowerShell module (v2.1.0+), PowerShell 7.0+, appropriate Active Directory
permissions. SeSecurityPrivilege required for -EnableAuditing (Domain Admin qualifies).

#   implicit — a diagnostics switch forced it on     -> never prompt (D8); a diagnostics
#                                                       re-run must stay copy-pasteable and

function Stop-TierModelDiagnosticsTranscript {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Stops the diagnostics transcript, but ONLY if this script started it.
    .DESCRIPTION
    ⛔ NEVER call Stop-Transcript unguarded. POC-3 inverted our original assumption: a *nested*
    Start-Transcript is harmless, but an unpaired Stop is not. If our Start-Transcript failed
    (for example under -WhatIf, where it silently creates nothing) while the OPERATOR'S OWN
    transcript is running, a bare Stop-Transcript SUCCEEDS and stops theirs — silently
    destroying their change record. Nothing throws, so a try/catch cannot save you.

    $script:TranscriptStarted is therefore load-bearing: it is set only after Test-Path has
    CONFIRMED that our transcript file exists, and it is the sole authority for whether we are
    allowed to stop anything. The flag is cleared afterwards so a second exit path cannot stop
    a transcript we no longer own.

    This is WI-08 "Option A": a guarded stop at each normal exit path (completion, throw, exit).
    ⚠️ KNOWN GAP (Ctrl-C): after a genuine Ctrl-C the transcript is left open and keeps
    capturing until the console exits. Closing that gap needs a try/finally around the whole
    2,000-line script body, which POC-9 eliminated the need for elsewhere and which is not worth
    the review cost; the trade is with Joel. If Option B is ever chosen, the only change needed
    is to wrap the script body and call this function from the finally — every call site below
    stays exactly as it is.

function Write-TierModelDiagnosticsHint {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Prints a copy-pasteable re-run line that adds -EnableVerbose -EnableDebug (WI-09).
    .DESCRIPTION
    Reconstructs the operator's actual invocation from the bound parameters captured at script
    start, then appends the two diagnostics switches. The result must be literally pasteable and
    non-interactive — which is why the auto-enable path never prompts for -OutputFileBase.

    Deliberately worded "for full diagnostics" rather than anything that implies the switches
    will reveal the cause: they may not, and promising a cause is how an operator ends up
    running the same failure twice and losing confidence in the tooling.
